# BudgetTracker

Budget Tracker application that allows for offline access and functionality

## Goal:

The goal was to utilize indexdb to connect a database in order to be create an application that can enter deposits offline, enter expenses offline and when brought back online adds that data.

## Issues:

- Need to re-visit the webpack config file and connect it properly.

## Results:

I was able to successfully use a mongoose database to record transaction data. I was able to use express and connect the pages. I was also able to use the app on and offline.
